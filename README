Cairo demonstration programs.

Here are several simple programs intended to demonstrate some of the
features of the CAiro graphics library (http://cairographics.org).

After installing Cairo, it is quite simple to compile these demo
programs. Just type:

	make

The demos in the png each draw to an in-memory image, then save that
image as a PNG file. These demos were created for the Cairo (Xr) paper
presented at the 2003 Ottawa Linux Symposium. They were intentionally
designed to showcase individual features of Cairo in a very simple
way. As such, the source code should be very easy to understand and
can make a good introduction to Cairo. More explanation can be found
in the paper which is available online:

	http://cairographics.org/xr_ols2003/

	(Note, the paper was written before Xr was renamed to Cairo,
	but with a simple mental substitution, it should still be easy
	to understand).

The demos in the X11 directory use Cairo's X11 backend to draw to a
window. Some of the examples (eg. cairo-freq and cairo-knockout)
automatically scale the drawing to fit the window. The cairo-spline
demo allows the user to interact with a mouse.

Have fun.
